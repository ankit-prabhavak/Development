CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

The meaning of Cascading in CSS is that the styles are applied in a cascading manner, meaning that the styles are applied in a
hierarchical order. The styles are applied from the most specific to the least specific.

Order: In Line Styles > Internal Styles > External Styles 

This order is very helpful in resolving conflicts between styles.


!Important is a keyword which is used to override the normal cascading order of CSS. It is used to set the priority of styles to higher than the 
normal styles.

<strong> is a tag used to produce audio as well as visual effect.


Advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript:

1.  Static Typing: TypeScript is statically typed, which means that the type of every expression must be specified.
2.  Intelligent Code Completion: TypeScript provides intelligent code completion, which helps in writing code faster and with fewer errors.

Duck Typing: Duck typing is a concept in programming where the type of an object is determined by the methods it supports, 
rather than the type of the object itself.
